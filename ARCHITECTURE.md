# Architecture

## Overview
Next.js 14 (App Router), deployed on Vercel. No database, no auth, no external
API keys. Two independent features share the same UI shell and formatting/math
utilities.

## Data flow — Screener
1. User enters a ticker → `GET /api/options?ticker=...&rate=...&commission=...`.
2. Route calls `lib/yahoo.js`:
   - `getOptionMeta` → spot price + list of expiration dates.
   - `getDailyCloses` → 1y of daily closes (for HV).
   - `getChainForDate` → per-expiration calls/puts.
3. Route computes, per contract: Black-Scholes Greeks (`lib/blackscholes.js`),
   IV/HV ratio (`lib/volatility.js` for HV), breakeven.
4. Filters, applied to the whole contract table (not just Best call/put):
   ±10 strikes around spot; OI ≥ 10 or volume ≥ 10; IV > 2%; DTE ≥ 2 (0-1 DTE
   contracts have near-zero extrinsic value); and `isSyntheticIv()` — skips
   Yahoo's IV-solver fallback values (see "Known fragility" below).
5. "Best call/put" = lowest IV/HV among contracts with |Delta| > 0.05 (so a
   far-OTM, short-dated contract with negligible payoff sensitivity can't win
   the ranking even with a genuine IV). `null` if nothing qualifies.
6. Returns JSON; `Screener.jsx` renders cards + sortable/filterable table,
   clicking a row pins it as a third "Selected contract" card.
7. Client-side, `Screener.jsx` also runs every currently-filtered row (and the
   selected contract) through `lib/analysis.js`'s `analyze()` — same engine
   the Trade analyzer uses — to get a probability of profit and a verdict per
   contract. That powers: the "Selected contract" card's mini-analysis (badge,
   summary, good/bad reasons) and the table's Chance/Deal columns plus the
   "Best chance" / "Best deal" quick-sort buttons (`pop` and `verdict.score`
   respectively). `ivRankPct` here is approximated from where the contract's
   IV sits in the 52-week HV band, since the screener has no real IV history.

## Data flow — Trade analyzer
Fully client-side, zero network calls. `lib/analysis.js`:
1. Black-Scholes price/Greeks from your entered IV (or your manually-pasted
   Greeks, which override the *displayed* values only — probability and P&L
   math always derive from the IV you entered, to stay internally consistent).
2. Probability of profit: lognormal terminal-price model using your IV and a
   chosen drift assumption (risk-free / zero / custom).
3. P&L scenario grid at expiration + a payoff curve at any holding horizon
   (via Black-Scholes repricing at that horizon, not just intrinsic value).
4. Verdict: transparent factor list (IV/HV, IV Rank, POP, breakeven distance,
   reward:risk, theta drag) summed into a badge, with hard caps — "Expensive"
   overrides everything if IV is rich, "Long-shot" overrides everything if POP
   is very low, regardless of how cheap the volatility looks.

## Key constants (tunable)
`app/api/options/route.js`: `MAX_EXPIRATIONS`, `STRIKE_WINDOW`, `MIN_OI`,
`MIN_VOL`, `MIN_IV`, `MIN_DTE_FOR_RANK`, `MIN_BEST_DELTA`.

## Internationalization
`lib/i18n.js` holds a flat `{ en: {...}, bg: {...} }` dictionary and
`t(lang, key, vars)` (supports `{var}` interpolation). It's used two ways:
- From components, via `useLanguage()` (`app/components/LanguageContext.jsx`),
  which wraps the whole app in `app/page.js` and exposes `{ lang, setLang, t }`.
  `t` here is pre-bound to the current language and persisted to localStorage.
- From `lib/analysis.js` directly (a plain module, not a component) — it takes
  `lang` as an input and calls the exported `t(lang, key, vars)` to build the
  verdict/factor strings, so the analyzer's model output is translated too.

Adding a UI string: add the key to both `en` and `bg` in `lib/i18n.js`, then
call `t('key')` (components) or `t(lang, 'key')` (lib/analysis.js).

## Deployment
- Vercel Git integration: push to `main` → production deploy. Push to any
  other branch / open a PR → preview deploy with its own URL.
- `/api/options` runs as a Node.js serverless function (`export const runtime
  = 'nodejs'`), not Edge — needed for the Yahoo cookie/crumb handshake.
- No environment variables required.

## Known fragility
Yahoo Finance is unofficial. If Vercel's datacenter IPs get rate-limited,
`lib/yahoo.js` is the single file to replace (with Tradier's free API or
similar) — the rest of the app only depends on the shape it returns.

Separately: Yahoo's own `impliedVolatility` field is frequently unreliable,
independent of rate-limiting. When its solver can't organically price a
contract, it silently returns a value from a small fixed template (within
~2% of an exact power of two × 1/128) instead of failing — observed
identically across unrelated tickers, strikes, and expiries. `isSyntheticIv()`
in `app/api/options/route.js` detects and skips these. In practice this can
still leave few or zero eligible contracts for some tickers/moments (e.g. a
low-realized-vol, densely-listed ETF right at the open) — that's the honest
result of Yahoo not having a trustworthy IV to offer, not a bug in the filter.
The screener surfaces this with an explicit "no reliable IV solve" message
rather than silently rendering fabricated Greeks.
